Welcome to scSHARP's documentation!
===================================
**scSHARP** is a software package used to classify single cells by cell type based on their transcriptomic profile generated from single-cell RNA sequencing. Intended for use by technically savvy research biologists, but perhaps available to a less technically proficient audience, our tool will be built with ease of use in mind. scSHARP would also serve as a research tool in its own right, helping users interpret their classification results with helpful models and figures. This document contains the technical information of scSHARP.

To learn more about the tool and research project the paper can be accessed `here <https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.11.23.517739>`_
