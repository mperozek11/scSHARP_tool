Welcome to scSHARP's documentation!
===================================

**scSHARP** is a robust software package used to classify single cells by cell type based on their transcriptomic profile generated from single-cell RNA sequencing. Intended for use by technically savvy research biologists, but perhaps available to a less technically proficient audience, our tool will be built with ease of use in mind. scSHARP would also serve as a research tool in its own right, helping users interpret their classification results with helpful models and figures. This document contains the technical information of scSHARP.
